<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>The <strong>Recipients</strong> is the count of the number of people to whom the email was successfully delivered. So it is basically intended recipients minus bounces.</p>
<p>A <strong>Contact Conversion</strong> means an individual who <em>was sent the mailing</em> and made one <em>or more</em> donations linked to the mailing. One contact who made several donations counts as one conversion.</p>
<p>A <strong>Contribution Conversion</strong> means a donation belonging to someone who <em>was sent the mailing</em> that is linked to the mailing. One contact who made 3 donations counts as 3 conversions. This will go up over time if they set up a recurring donation.</p>
<p>The <strong>Conversion Rate %</strong> is the number of conversions divided by the number of recipients.</p>
<p>Note: these figures may differ from those on the <a href="https://support.opendemocracy.net/civicrm/dataviz/odd" >od Donations explorer</a> in the case that someone made a payment linked to this mailing but who was not sent the mailing themself (e.g. their friend forwarded it).</p>
